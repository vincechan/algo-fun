# BITWISE XOR

## Important Properties of XOR

Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0

- 1 ^ 1 = 0
- 55 ^ 55 = 0

Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number

- 1 ^ 0 = 1
- 55 ^ 0 = 55

XOR is Associative and Commutative

\*\* There are often other methods to solve the same problems XOR can solve, but may require more memory. e.g in two single number problem, using XOR will use O(1) memory, but using Set will use O(N) memory.
