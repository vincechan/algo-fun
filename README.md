# Overview

This project is a playground to practice solving algorithmic problems with Typescript. Why Typescript? Killing 2 birds with 1 stone - want to practice Typescript too =).

## Folder structure

The problems that can be solved by the same pattern are organized and stored in same folder: `src\patterns\{pattern-subfolder}`.

* `src\patterns\{pattern-subfolder}\{problem}.ts` contains the implementation
* `src\patterns\{pattern-subfolder}\{problem}.test.ts` contains the test

## Running

To verify the implementation, run all tests: 

`yarn test`
